# videotitlesearch

I created this web app as another way to search my analog video synthesis catalog on Vimeo. Type in a letter and titles of various videos will be suggested to the user. Each title is embedded with a link to the video on Vimeo. With the help of "react-gh-pages", this application is deployed through github, being hosted by it's own repository.
